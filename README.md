# Odin Recipes

This is a simple **static HTML project** from The Odin Project, where I’m building a basic multi-page recipe website. The site is built using **HTML** with **basic CSS styles** for layout and presentation.

## Project Overview

- Main index page linking to individual recipe pages
- Each recipe page includes:
  - A title and image of the dish
  - A short description
  - An ingredient list
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Navigation links back to the home page

## What I’m Learning

This project helps practice fundamental web development skills:

- Writing clean, semantic HTML
- Organizing content with headings, paragraphs, and lists
- Linking multiple pages with relative paths
- Applying basic CSS for layout, spacing, and simple styling
- Structuring files into directories for a small multi-page website

# Odin Recipes  

This is a simple project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) where I’m building a basic recipe website using only **HTML**.  

The site starts with a main index page that links to individual recipe pages. Each recipe page includes:  
- A title and an image of the dish  
- A short description  
- An ingredient list  
- Step-by-step instructions  
- Links for easy navigation back to the home page  

## What I’m Learning  

By working on this project, I’m practicing the core building blocks of web development:  
- Writing clean and semantic HTML  
- Structuring content with headings, paragraphs, and lists  
- Linking multiple pages together with relative paths  
- Organizing files into directories  
- Building a small multi-page website from scratch  

This is my first step in learning web development, and while it’s simple, it’s a solid foundation before moving on to CSS and JavaScript.

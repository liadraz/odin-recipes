                This mushroom Cheddar soup, comforting and hearty, is a full-flavored mix of earthy mushrooms and
                luscious
                cheeses. It’s deliciously rich and creamy, and is just as good for dinner parties as it is for busy
                weeknight
                dinners all year round.

            <h2 class="header-two">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>16 ounces cremini (Baby Bella) mushrooms, sliced</li>
                <li></li>1/2 cup minced shallots</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
                <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon dry sherry (optional)</li>
                <li></li>1 1/2 cups shredded white Cheddar cheese, such as Costco’s Coastal English Cheddar</li>
                <li>1 (5.3 ounce) package Boursin® Shallot and Chive spreadable cheese, crumbled</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>chopped fresh parsley for garnish</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="header-two">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until
                    they
                    release their liquid and it evaporates, about 10 minutes. Add shallots and garlic; cook, stirring
                    frequently, until shallots are softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add flour and stir constantly for about 2 minutes. Gradually pour in chicken broth, half-and-half,
                    and
                    sherry. Bring to a simmer, stirring often.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to low, stirring occasionally until soup starts to slightly thicken, about 10 minutes.
                    Add
                    Cheddar and Boursin, and stir just until cheese has melted. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle with parsley to serve.</li>
            </ol>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This mushroom Cheddar soup, comforting and hearty, is a full-flavored mix of earthy mushrooms and luscious
        cheeses. It’s deliciously rich and creamy, and is just as good for dinner parties as it is for busy weeknight
        dinners all year round.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>16 ounces cremini (Baby Bella) mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li></li>1/2 cup minced shallots</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dry sherry (optional)</li>
        <li></li>1 1/2 cups shredded white Cheddar cheese, such as Costco’s Coastal English Cheddar</li>
        <li>1 (5.3 ounce) package Boursin® Shallot and Chive spreadable cheese, crumbled</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>chopped fresh parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until they
            release their liquid and it evaporates, about 10 minutes. Add shallots and garlic; cook, stirring
            frequently, until shallots are softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add flour and stir constantly for about 2 minutes. Gradually pour in chicken broth, half-and-half, and
            sherry. Bring to a simmer, stirring often.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low, stirring occasionally until soup starts to slightly thicken, about 10 minutes. Add
            Cheddar and Boursin, and stir just until cheese has melted. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with parsley to serve.</li>
    </ol>

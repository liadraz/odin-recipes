        <h2 class="header-two">Description</h2>
        <p>This delicious recipe for Saskatoon berries (called serviceberries in some markets) is a cross between a
            crisp
            and a crumble. The flavor of the Saskatoon berry goes so well with cream cheese. The cake will be a little
            crumbly to eat, but it is very delicious!

            <h2 class="header-two">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan.</li>
                <li>Make the crust and topping: Whisk brown sugar, flour, oats, and cinnamon together in a bowl.
                    Gradually
                    stir
                    in oil until mixture is crumbly. Press 1/2 of the mixture into the prepared pan for the crust; set
                    the
                    rest
                    aside for the topping.</li>
                <li>Bake crust in the preheated oven until firm, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool
                    slightly;
                    leave the oven on.</li>
                <li>Make the filling: Bring serviceberries and water to a simmer in a saucepan. Cook for 10 minutes,
                    then
                    stir
                    in lemon juice. Whisk white sugar and flour together in a small bowl; stir sugar mixture into
                    berries
                    and
                    cook until mixture begins to thicken, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for a few
                    minutes,
                    then pour over crust.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle cream cheese pieces evenly over filling. Spread reserved crumb mixture over cream cheese
                    gently
                    press onto filling with a potato masher.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crumb topping is golden and filling is bubbly, about 40 minutes.
